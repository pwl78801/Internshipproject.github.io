      <h2>Successes and Failures: Road to Financial Modeling using a web scraper</h2>
	  
     
      
      <p>THESIS: Create a web scraper in Excel to help predict future stock prices trading on the NYSE into a certin margin of error. I will record findings below. .<br>
	  
	   <!--  <br> Thinking to myself: " I have no idea what I got myself into but i like where it is going. Think BIG!! ASK FOR HELP AROUND THE OFFICE!!!!! on Monday ask justin if i can get python and CS code editor on my work computer so i can work on it in my down time.  -->
	  <br>-Intial Reaction:  How do I start?
	  <br>
	  
	  <br> First thought: go onto YouTube, W3schools, or Github to get guidence.
	  
	  <br>
	  
	  <br> 
	  Brainstorm a plan / words :
	  <br>
	  Step 1: Build aWebscraper. The Webscaper will give us key data and put it into a table. <br>
	  Step 2: Then I will create an model with the data to come out with a predicted varible/number. <br>
	  Step 3: Add-in/ predict my margin of error for the outputs. <br>

		<strong>Experinces </strong>
		<br><br>
		DAY: 1 {6/10/2019}
		<br>
		<br>
		After 3 hours of trail and error in python and getting the .csv files to work and have everything in a data table with labels and such, I didnt have engough time to do it in python.\
		I need some more help in python before I can try to make programs on my own. I need an hour long refresher on python.
		I moved to excel to see if the same process on a much simpler version could be feasiable. 
		I found some Youtube videos that gave me key insight.<br><br> <a href="https://programmingforfinance.com/2018/06/web-scraping-fundamental-data-for-stocks-no-api/">1. -Source Code-</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJLMRo0oGU8">2.-Source Video-</a><br><br>
		
 <!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJLMRo0oGU8 -->		<br>
 <br> WE FINALLY GOT IT. After a few tweaks to the program provided by <a href="https://programmingforfinance.com/2018/06/web-scraping-fundamental-data-for-stocks-no-api/">Frank-programmingforfinance </a>. We now have a functioning scaprer that looks something like this. 
 
<br>
I like using excel for the process because the table just came out cleaner and it seems ike excel is perfered in the business world.
		<br>
		<br>
		DAY: 2 {6/11/2019}
		<br>
		<br>
		After completing the task at hand on Monday, I took a day off. 
		<br>
		<br>
		DAY: 3 {6/12/2019}
		<br>
		<br>
		I decided to give it a go again. This time I need to take the data from excel and put that into a predictive model. 
		My table is coming out clean but it slows down the more stock tickers I put in. I need to find a way to process them quicker. 
		My idea would be to pull less data for each value because I really don't think I need the Market Cap of each stock to predict price as much as using price as an actual predictor. 
		For the predictive model im going to need to look into a way or find some source code to help me along the process. 
		Also I think time it takes to pull the request for Yahoo Finance is slowing down the scraper. 
		
		<!--My boss, Sandy, stopped by. She thought it was cool and to keep working on it. I only have ten more minutes before I have to go to my next meeting. I want to keep working on this project but I have to go ;(.-->	
		<br>
		Ok today was a very sucessful trial run for gathering data. I made just a few more tweaks to the source code to obtain moving averages, price, high and low for each day. 
		<br>
		<br>
		DAY: 4 {6/12/2019}
		<br>
		<br> 
		I need to clean up the website aspect of this project.

				<p>IN CONCLUSION:<br></p>
			I NEVER WANT TO SIFT THROUGH A JSON AGAIN

		<!--	<br>Where I get my insipraton:<br> My insipiration comes from those who I surround myslef with and those who I look up too. 
			I look up to people who have made big impacts on other peoples lives such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. 
			I also like to assioctae my leadership through sports; I like to look up to people like Roger Federer and Kobe Byrant. 
			The last people and most important people that give me insipration are those who don't beilive in the same dream that i do. 
			Everyday i face the challenges of warding off people that want to bring you down, but i just have to ignore those who dont believe in the dream.
			I truly beilive that if you want something you need to aquire the certin set of skills to obtain that goal. If you want to be a millionaire get a plan together to make money. 
			If you want to be a superstar athelete you need to have dedecation that people like Kevin Durant have. 
			My goal in life is help and change as many lives for the betterment of society.
			<br>
				<br> 
				<br>What im currently up to:
				<br> I currently have an intership at MRI Software and work for an amazing group of people. I am currently making plans to go to Utah or Montana.
